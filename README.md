# Project Background
SpaceX is the most successful company of the commercial space age, making space travel affordable. The company advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. Based on public information and machine learning models, we are going to predict if SpaceX will reuse the first stage.

# Questions to be answered
How do variables such as payload mass, launch site, number of flights, and orbits affect the success of the first stage landing?
Does the rate of successful landings increase over the years?
What is the best Classification algorithm can be used for prediction in this case?

# Methodology
  # Data collection methodology:
      Data Collection using an SpaceX REST API
      Using Web Scraping to get the data from Website.
  # Perform data wrangling
      Using REST API to get into the actual information.
      Dealing with the Missing Values.
  # Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using visualization and SQL
      Analyzing the data whether the data can be directly used to build a machine Learning Model for successful landing.
  # Perform interactive visual analytics using Folium and Plotly Dash
      Building an interactive maps.
      Creating Dashboards from the resultant data for Visualization.
  # Perform predictive analysis using classification models
      Using the data we create a Machine Learning Model to predict the success rate of Landing.
      Using Various Classification Algorithms to test the model with best Accuracy.
